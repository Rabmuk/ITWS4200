When setting up my personal git repository I found it was easier to create the repository locally using the github windows client. This allowed me to keep the folder outside of the default location of the github client.

As a group we tried to implement bugzilla for bug tracking, but we ran into complications trying to install it on a remote web hosting service. We decided to use githubs built in issue tracking system for its ability to discuss and assign bugs. It also required no additional setup.
